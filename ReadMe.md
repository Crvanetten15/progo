> Progress ABL CLI in GoLang

#### Motive

For new developers dealing with OpenEdge Progress ABL it can be a challenge to navigate its vaste tools. Specifically, the fact that ABL has multiple different tools for viewing DBs, editing your code, compiling and so on. _ProGo_ looks to improve on this problem by making custom tools for your to help with working with Progress ABL.

> Notice : ProGo is an extension of [ProVM](https://github.com/Crvanetten15/provm), a Progress ABL Version Manager also maintained by me. Overall, ProGo can be run independently, but the config file that you can create and maintain in ProVM will be needed so it is best top have both installed. From ProVM, you are able to install this CLI.
